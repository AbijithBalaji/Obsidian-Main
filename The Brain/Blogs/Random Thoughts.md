Whenever am broken into pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle you fix me with ease as if you exactly knew which piece goes where 

Whatever i feel like am able to share it with you without a second thought that much of a comfort am in when i am with you 

When You are with me i get the confidence like i can pull off anything in this world 

Even in a room full of fine quality arts i would still be found staring you looking myself in your eyes  

I ain't perfect in fact no one is or could be if you ask me. The imperfections are what makes everyone unique. If you love someone, you are in love with the imperfections 

I ain't perfect because no one taught me how to be so. I learnt most of them the hard way and i feel that the term 'perfect' is a very subjective thing which carry a different definition in the books of different people. 

We all know the science behind building muscles right? What happens for muscle growth is called muscle hypertrophy. We all have seen athletes and body builders workout in gym by lifting heavy weights to build muscle right. Have we ever thought why they do so and how those things actually work!?
So what happens is whenever one targets a particular muscle group, for example - bicep, and train it using lifting weights, What happens is due to the strain of lifting heavy weight and constant tension over that muscle region, small wear and tear occurs in the existing muscles of that region. 
We all know protein is needed to build muscles. So provided with sufficient protein and proper rest for recovery, The wear and tear is slow fixed by rebuilding new muscle fibres at that region which are bigger and stronger than the previous one. 

So on one perspective, we can see this as :
Being under constant pressure and tension in a controlled environment actually helps one to grow and prepare themselves so that they can manage and help themselves in an uncontrolled environment

For me being in love is something everyone needs. The feeling of having someone thinking and caring about you other than your parents of course is really great. Just imagine having someone who's interested to hear out how your day go
